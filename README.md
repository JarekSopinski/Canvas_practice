## Canvas practice

HTML5 Canvas exercises. Almost all of them are based on a great canvas tutorial by [Christopher Lis (Chris Courses)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA). The only exception is "canvas header BG" where I experimented with using interactive canvas animation as a background and tried to integrate it with a simple landing page.
